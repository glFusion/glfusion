## Requirements

**Web Server supporting PHP**

glFusion will run on any web server that supports PHP. Modern web servers such as Apache, Nginx, Caddy, LiteSpeed, IIS, Lighttpd,and Abyss are known to work.

**PHP version 7.0.0 or later**

PHP needs to be at least version 7.0.0, the latest PHP release is highly
recommended and well supported by glFusion.

**MySQL v5.0.15 or later**

MySQL needs to be at least v5.0.15. It is highly recommended that you run a newer
version of MySQL, v5.7 or higher (including MySQL v8). The MySQL Group continues
to provide support for v5.0 and v5.1 on older operating systems.

glFusion also supports MariaDB v5.1 or newer. MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for
MySQL. MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database.
The MariaDB Foundation ensures continuity and open collaboration in the MariaDB
ecosystem. The foundation guarantees that there is a global contact point for
collaboration and that the community can always rely upon MariaDB Server.

**Ability to write to the web space**

glFusion does require that certain directories in the public web space be
writable. For example, the backend/ directory is where the RSS files are
kept. This directory must be writable by the web server. During the
installation, the installer will automatically create the siteconfig.php
file in the root of your web space, so the installer will need to have
write access.

**A Modern Web Browser**

glFusion supports modern web browsers, including IE 9+, Microsoft Edge, Chrome,
Firefox and Opera. **Older browsers are not well supported.**
