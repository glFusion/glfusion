            <title>Vulcan Seat on a Mean Streak</title>
            <link>https://gldev.leegarner.com/article.php/vulcan-mean-streak-seat</link>
            <description>Can you modify a Vulcan seat to fit the Mean Streak? Apparently you can. While this mod is specifically to get a Vulcan Classic seat to fit a Mean Streak, perhaps it will help others make similar mods...  &quot;Mulefeathers&quot; writes:  I want to document and share my steps in the conversation of a 2007 Vulcan Classic to my 2003 Mean Streak.  [vulcan seat mod1]The first thing I had to fix was the tab on the Vulcan is quite a bit larger than the mean streak so I had to sand down and resize. I have not sanded down the bumpers. I might after I ride for a little while but as of now, no.</description>
