				<h1>Spam-X</h1>
				<p>
					glFusion includes multiple layers of defense against spam, the Spam-X plugin is one of the key defenses. It has a modular architecture that allows it to be extended with new modules to fight the spammer's latest tricks, should the need arise.
				</p>

				<p>
					glFusion and the Spam-X plugin will check the following for spam:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Story submissions</li>
					<li>Comments</li>
					<li>Trackbacks and Pingbacks</li>
					<li>Event submissions</li>
					<li>Link submissions</li>
					<li>Forum Posts</li>
					<li>The text sent with the &ldquo;Email story to a friend&rdquo; option</li>
					<li>Emails sent to users via the &ldquo;send email&rdquo; form from their profile page</li>
					<li>A user's profile</li>
				</ul>


			<h1>Module Types</h1>

				<p>
					The Spam-X plugin was built to be expandable to easily adapt to
					changes the comment spammers might make. There are three types of
					modules: Examine, Action, and Admin. A new module is contained in a
					file and can simply be dropped in and it will be added to the plugin.
					Examine Modules
				</p>

				<p>
					glFusion ships with the following examine modules:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Stop Forum Spam (SFS)</li>
					<li>Spam Link Counter (SLC)</li>
					<li>Akismet</li>
					<li>Personal Blacklist</li>
					<li>IP Filter</li>
					<li>IP of URL Filter</li>
					<li>HTTP Header Filter</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Stop Forum Spam (SFS)</h2>

				<p>
					SFS is a centralized, server-based service that examines posts
					made on websites and detects when certain links show up in unusually high
					numbers. In other words, when a spammer starts spamming a lot of sites
					with the same URLs and those sites all report to SFS, the system will
					recognize this as a spam wave and will flag posts containing these URLs
					as spam.
				</p>


				<p>In other words still, it's a dynamic blacklist that
					automatically updates itself when a spammer starts spamming for their site. And it
					can only get better (in terms of accuracy and reaction speed) the more
					sites use it.
				</p>


				<p>
					SFS is a free service run by Project Honey Pot at <a href="https://www.projecthoneypot.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.projecthoneypot.org/</a>.
				</p>


				<p>Privacy Notice: It should be stressed that using SFS means
					that information from your site is being sent to a third party's site. In
					some legislations you may have to inform your users about this fact -
					please check with your local privacy laws.
				</p>

				<p>Sending information to an external site may also be
					undesirable on some setups, e.g. on a company intranet. You can disable SFS support by
					removing the four files SFS.Examine.class.php, SFSbase.class.php and
					SFSreport.Action.class.php files from your
					Spam-X directory (/path/to/glfusion/plugins/spamx/modules). Or you can simply
					disable the Spam-X plugin entirely (or uninstall it).
				</p>

				<h2>Spam Link Counter (SLC)</h2>

				<p>
					SLC will examine a post and determine how many links to external sites are in the post.
					Anything more than 5 (configurable via the Online configuration) will be flagged as
					spam and rejected.
				</p>

				<h2>Akismet</h2>

				<p>
 					Used by millions of websites, Akismet filters out hundreds of millions of spam comments from the Web every day.
 					Sign up and get your Akismet Key at https://akismet.com/account/

				</p>

				<h2>Personal Blacklist</h2>

				<p>
					The Personal Blacklist module lets you add keywords and URLs that
					typically exist in spam posts. When you're being hit by spam, make sure
					to add the URLs of those spam posts to your Personal Blacklist so that
					they can be filtered out automatically, should the spammer try to post
					them again.
				</p>

				<p>
					This will also help you get rid of spam that made it through, as you
					can then use the Mass Delete Comments and Mass Delete Trackbacks
					modules to easily remove large numbers of spam posts from your
					database.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Personal Blacklist also has an option to import the glFusion
					censor list and ban all comments which contain one of those words. This
					or an expanded list might be useful for a website that caters to
					children. Then no comments with offensive language could be posted.
				</p>

				<h2>IP Filter</h2>

				<p>
					Sometimes you will encounter spam that is coming from one or only a
					few IP addresses. By simply adding those IP addresses to the IP Filter
					module, any posts from these IPs will be blocked automatically.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition to single IP addresses, you can also add IP address ranges,
					either in CIDR notation or as simple from-to ranges.
				</p>

				<p>
					Please note that IP addresses aren't really a good filter
					criterion. While some ISPs and hosting services are known to host spammers, it
					won't help much to block an IP address by one of the well-known ISPs.
					Often, the spammer will get a new IP address the next time he connects
					to the internet, while the blocked IP address will be reused and may be
					used by some innocent user.
				</p>

				<h2>IP of URL Filter</h2>

				<p>
					This module is only useful in a few special cases: Here you enter
					the IP address of a webserver that is used to host domains for which
					you may see spam. Some spammers have a lot of their sites on only a few
					webservers, so instead of adding lots of domains to your blacklist, you
					only add the IP addresses of those webservers. The Spam-X module will
					then check all the URLs in a post to see if any of these is hosted on
					one of those blacklisted webservers.
				</p>

				<h2>HTTP Header Filter</h2>

				<p>
					This module lets you filter for certain HTTP headers. Every HTTP request sent
					to your site is accompanied by a series of headers identifying, for example,
					the browser that your visitors uses, their preferred language, and other information.
				</p>

				<p>
					With the Header filter module, you can block HTTP requests with certain headers.
					For example, some spammers are using Perl scripts to send their spam posts. The user agent (browser
					identification) sent by Perl scripts is usually something like &ldquo;libwww-perl/5.805&rdquo;
					(the version number may vary). So to block posts made by this user agent, you would
					enter:
				</p>

				<table class="uk-table">
					<tr>
						<td>Header: </td>
						<td>User-Agent </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Content: </td>
						<td>^libwww-perl </td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>
					This would block all posts from user agents beginning with
					&ldquo;libwww-perl&rdquo;.
				</p>

				<h2>Action Modules</h2>

				<p>
					Once one of the examine modules detects a spam post, the action
					modules will decide what to do with the spam. Most of the time, you
					will simply want to delete the post then, so this is what the Delete
					Action module does.
				</p>

				<p>
					As the name implies, the Mail Admin Action module sends an email to
					the site admin when a spam post is encountered. Since this can cause
					quite a lot of emails being sent, it is disabled by default.
				</p>

				<p>
					Action modules have to be enabled specifically before they are used
					(examine modules, on the other hand, are activated by simply dropping
					them into the Spam-X directory). For this, every action module has a
					unique number that needs to be added up with the number of the other
					action modules you want to enable and entered as the value for the
					spamx config variable in glFusion's main configuration.
				</p>

				<h2>Example</h2>

				<p>
					The Delete Action module has the value 128, while the Mail Admin
					Action module has the value 8. So to activate both modules, add 128 + 8
					= 136 and enter that in the Configuration admin panel.
				</p>

				<h2>Admin Modules</h2>

				<p>
					The Admin modules for the Personal Blacklist, IP Filter, IP of URL
					Filter, and HTTP Header Filter modules provide you with a form to add new entries. To
					delete an existing entry, simply click on it.
				</p>


				<p>
					The Log View module lets you inspect and clear the Spam-X logfile. The
					logfile contains additional information about the spam posts, e.g.
					which IP address they came from, the user id (if posted by a logged-in
					user), and which of the examine modules caught the spam post.
				</p>

				<p>
					In case a large number of spam posts made it through without
					being caught, the Mass Delete Comments and Mass Delete Trackbacks modules
					will help you get rid of them easily. Before you use these modules,
					make sure to add the URLs or keywords from those spams to your Personal
					Blacklist.
				</p>

				<h2>Trackback Spam</h2>

				<p>
					Trackbacks are also run through Spam-X before they will be
					accepted by glFusion. There are also some additional checks that can be
					performed on trackbacks: glFusion can be configured to check if the
					site that supposedly sent the trackback actually contains a link back
					to your site. In addition, glFusion can also check if the IP address of
					the site in the trackback URL matches the IP address that sent the trackback.
					Trackbacks that fail any of these tests are usually spam. Please refer to
					the documentation for the configuration for more information.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Spam-X plugin's configuration can be changed from the Configuration
					admin panel: Spam-X Main Settings
