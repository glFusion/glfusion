				<h1>Static Pages Content</h1>

				<p>
					The Static Pages plugin was originally aimed at creating pages
					with static content (as opposed to the dynamic pages created by
					glFusion) - hence the name. Pages like an &ldquo;about
					us&rdquo; page, a mission statement, etc. would come to mind.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since then, people have used the static pages for all kinds of
					things and with the inclusion of PHP into
					static pages, even the original name isn't quite right any more
					&hellip; Features
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>supports use of PHP</li>
					<li>editable page ID to make more readable URLs</li>
					<li>Static pages can be displayed on glFusion's index and topic pages and can even replace it entirely (&ldquo;splash screen&rdquo;)</li>
					<li>&ldquo;cloning&rdquo; of existing pages</li>
					<li>Makes use of glFusion's URL rewrite feature</li>
					<li>Provides [staticpage:] and [staticpage_content:] autotags</li>
					<li>proper support for glFusion permissions</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Use of PHP</h1>

				<p>
					PHP in Staticpages is enabled by default on new install of glFusion.
					It is important to understand if you allow other users (members of the Static
					Page Admin group) to create staticpages, you may elect to disable the use of PHP
					in static pages.
				</p>

				<h2>De-Activating PHP</h2>

				<p>
					To disaable PHP use, you will have to remove the 'staticpages.PHP' permission from
					the &ldquo;Static Page Admin&rdquo; group. To do this, log in as the Admin and from
					the Admin's Only block, select &ldquo;Groups&rdquo;. Find the &ldquo;Static Page
					Admin&rdquo; group and edit it by clicking on the name of the group. At the bottom
					of the page, you will find a list of &ldquo;Rights&rdquo; (permissions) that can be
					granted to all members of this group. Note that 'staticpages.delete' and 'staticpages.edit'
					are also checked. To remove the ability for&nbsp; members of the Static Page Admin group to
					use PHP in static pages, you will have to un-check the 'staticpages.PHP' checkbox and save
					your changes.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition to the 'staticpages.PHP' permission discussed above, there is also a
					global option to disable the use of PHP in static pages entirely. That option
					&ldquo;Allow PHP?&rdquo; can be found in the Configuration admin panel for the
					static pages plugin. When set to &ldquo;False&rdquo;, that option will override
					the 'staticpages.PHP' permission and disable all use of PHP in static pages.
				</p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>

				<div class="uk-alert uk-alert-danger">
					The use of PHP in static pages may result in security issues if not used properly. Use this
					feature with care!
				</div>

				<p>
					The use of PHP as to be enabled for each individual static page.
					Below the content edit field, you will find a drop-down menu with
					the following options:
				</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>do not execute PHP</dt>
					<dd>When you select this option, any PHP code in the static page will not be executed but will instead be printed out as-is.</dd>
				</dl>

				<dl>
					<dt>execute PHP (return)</dt>
					<dd>If you select this option, PHP code in static pages will be executed. The 'return' indicates that the code should return any output it generates, using a PHP return statement, instead of printing it out directly. </dd>
				</dl>

				<dl>
					<dt>execute PHP</dt>
					<dd>Again, this option will enable execution of PHP. Only this time, the PHP code can actually use echo and print statements without having the output interfere with the page layout. </dd>
				</dl>

				<p>
					Please note that when embedding PHP code in a static page, your code should not be enclosed
					in the PHP &lt;?php and ?&gt; tags. Instead, it is assumed that the static page contains
					the PHP code that would normally go between those two tags.
				</p>

				<p>
					When selecting the third of the above PHP execution
					options (&ldquo;execute PHP&rdquo;) you can switch back and forth between PHP and plain HTML like this:
				</p>

				<pre class="code">echo "Hello"; ?&gt;, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;?php echo "how are you?";</pre>

				<p>
					The above example would print out &ldquo;Hello, <b>world</b>, how
					are you?&rdquo;.
				</p>

				<h1>Page ID</h1>

				<p>
					When creating a new static page, it will be assigned a page ID
					automatically. This ID consists of the date and time and up to three
					random digits. When you anticipate that the URL of this page may be used
					a lot, e.g. quoted in emails, it may make sense to use a more readable ID for the page.
				</p>

				<p>
					The static pages editor will let you change the page ID. For
					example, you may want to rename the ID for your
					&ldquo;about&rdquo; page from
					&ldquo;20030313100131123&rdquo; to &ldquo;about&rdquo;,
					thus creating a URL
					like
				</p>

				<pre class="code">http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=about</pre>


				<p>
					which looks much nicer when quoted (and is easier to
					remember). You could further improve this by making use of glFusion's URL rewrite
					feature.
				</p>

				<p>
					Please note that you should only use letters and digits for
					the page ID. Avoid national special characters, most punctuation
					characters ('-' and '.' should be okay, though) and spaces. The static
					page editor will catch some illegal characters but not all of them
					&hellip; Using Static Pages on the index page
				</p>

				<p>
					glFusion's Center Blocks concept allows plugins to place
					blocks in the center area of a glFusion site, i.e. among the stories.
				</p>


				<p>
					When you check the &ldquo;Centerblock&rdquo; option
					for a static page, you can use the &ldquo;Position&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;Topic&rdquo; drop-downs to chose where this static page
					will be displayed. For &ldquo;Position&rdquo;, the options are
					&ldquo;Top Of Page&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Featured
					Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bottom Of Page&rdquo; (which should be
					self-explanatory) and &ldquo;Entire Page&rdquo;. That last
					option, &ldquo;Entire Page&rdquo;, will tell glFusion that this
					static page will replace the entire index page - it will not display
					any stories, but only the contents of this static page. This is useful
					e.g. for &ldquo;splash&rdquo; screens or Welcome pages.
				</p>


				<div class="uk-alert">
					When using a static page as a
					&ldquo;splash&rdquo; screen, you may need a link that takes
					your visitors to the normal index page, i.e. the list of current
					stories. To do this, create a link to index.php?display=all
				</div>

				<p>
					The second drop-down, &ldquo;Topic&rdquo;, lets you
					restrict the display of a static page to only a certain topic, the
					homepage only, or all pages (i.e. all topic pages and the homepage).
					This is the same as the options you have for blocks.
				</p>


				<div class="uk-alert">
					You can combine these options with
					the permission settings. This will let you, for example, create a
					&ldquo;welcome&rdquo; page that is only displayed to anonymous
					users.
				</div>


				<h1>Sorting</h1>


				<p>
					Centerblocks: When you have more than one static page that
					would appear in the same section of the center area (e.g. two static
					pages that would be displayed at the top of the index page), you can
					choose the order in which they appear from the Configuration admin
					panel for the static pages plugin. Your options are:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Date (sort by last changed date)</li>
					<li>Page ID (sort by the page id; default)</li>
					<li>Page Title (sort by the page title)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Please note that this order will only apply to centerblocks
					from static pages. All other plugins creating centerblocks will not be
					in that order. Also note that the centerblock is not necessarily
					looking like a standard glFusion block. To achieve that, please check
					the field &ldquo;Wrapping Static Pages in a block&rdquo; below.
				</p>


				<p>
					Menu entries: It's also possible to sort the static pages that
					are displayed in the site's menu (if you're using a theme that uses the
					{plg_menu_elements} variables in its header.thtml). This sort order can
					also be changed in the Configuration admin panel for the static pages
					plugin:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Date (sort by last changed date)</li>
					<li>Label (sort by the menu label text; default)</li>
					<li>Page ID (sort by the page id)</li>
					<li>Page Title (sort by the page title)</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Wrapping Static Pages in a block</h1>

				<p>
					You can chose to have a static page wrapped in a glFusion
					block-layout by checking the &ldquo;wrap static page in a
					block&rdquo; option in the static pages editor. If selected, the
					page's title will be used as the block title. Further, you can, as with
					normal blocks, enter a help URL. If this URL is entered, the block will
					display a help icon linking to that URL.
				</p>

				<p>
					The default for this option can be set in the Configuration
					admin panel for the static pages plugin. Cloning Static Pages
				</p>

				<p>
					When you have a lot of similar static pages you may want to
					make a copy of an existing page and then edit that copy. This can
					easily be done by clicking on the [C] from the list of static pages.
					Doing so will create a copy of that page with a new page ID.
				</p>

				<h1>URL rewriting</h1>

				<p>
					Please note that this feature is considered experimental and
					is known not to work with IIS.
				</p>

				<p>
					glFusion supports a form of URL
					rewriting, i.e. change the look of URLs such that they are more search
					engine friendly. For example, instead of
				</p>


				<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=20030313100131123</pre>


				<p>the URL
				could look like this </p>


				<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/20030313100131123</pre>


				<p>Some search engines are known not to index pages when the URL
					includes characters like '?' and '='. You could further improve the
					chances of this page being indexed by replacing the numeric page ID
					with a word or expression (preferrably something that corresponds to
				the page's content), e.g. </p>


				<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/about</pre>


				<p>To make use of URL
					rewriting, you will need to set the option &ldquo;Enable URL
				Rewriting&rdquo; to True in glFusion's Configuration admin panel. </p>


				<h1>Deleting pages with their owner</h1>


				<p>As all objects in glFusion, static pages have an owner (the
					user that created the static page). When that user's account is deleted
					for some reason, any static pages owned by that user can either be
					deleted as well or they can be assigned to another user in glFusion's
				Root group. </p>


				<p>In the Configuration admin panel for the static pages plugin,
					you can set the &ldquo;Delete Pages with Owner?&rdquo; option
					to either &ldquo;False&rdquo; (which is also the default),
					meaning that static pages will not be deleted withtheir owner, but
					assigned to a member of the Root group instead (the user withthe lowest
					user ID, most likely the Admin). Setting the option to
					&ldquo;True&rdquo; means that static pages will be deleted when
				their owner's account is deleted.</p>
