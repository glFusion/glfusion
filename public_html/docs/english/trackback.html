				<h1>Trackback, Pingback, Ping</h1>

				<p>
					Trackbacks, Pingbacks, and Pings are mostly used in blog
					communities to
					inform other sites / blogs about updated blogs and comments made to
					blog posts. These methods are supported by many blog / CMS
					packages, so you can also send Trackbacks and Pingbacks to sites
					running on software other than glFusion.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Trackbacks are a means to connect a post you made on your blog to a
						post on another blog. <br/> e.g. Mary posts something on her blog.
						Peter reads that, makes a post about Mary's post on his own site
						and then sends a trackback to Mary's site, so that Mary and
						visitors of Mary's site will know about Peter's post.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pingbacks are pretty much the same as Trackbacks, they only use a
						different protocol.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sending a Ping is meant to inform sites that keep track of updated
						blogs that you've made a new post. These weblog directories or
						aggregators usually offer a way to subscribe to this update
						information, so that you don't have to visit several sites to find
						the new posts.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					For more information, please consult Wikipedia on TrackBack and
					Pingback. You can also spend some time reading up on Weblogs in general
					there &hellip;
				</p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>

				<p>
					To pick up the above example, here's how trackback, etc. work:
					Assume you're Peter and just read a post on Mary's blog about her
					little lamb. Say that post has the URL
					<code>http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb</code>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Peter now goes and writes a new story, linking to Mary's post.
					Something like:
				</p>

				<p>
					I just read that Mary <code>http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb</code> has
					a little lamb. Hope she posts some pictures soon!
				</p>

				<p>
					After saving that story, there is an option &ldquo;send
					ping&rdquo; in the Admin's
					list of stories (last column). Clicking on the link presents you with a
					list of options: Send Pingback, Send Ping, Send Trackback (some of
					those may have been disabled and not show up - see below).
				</p>

				<h2>Pingback</h2>

				<p>
					Sending a Pingback is an automated process: After clicking on that
					link, glFusion scans your story for links to other sites and tries to
					send a Pingback to all those sites that accept Pingbacks. The Pingback
					will automatically include a link back to your story.
				</p>

				<h2>Trackback</h2>

				<p>
					(We're skipping sending Pings for the moment - see below)
				</p>

				<p>
					A Trackback can only be sent to one site, so you are now presented
					with a list of all the links in your story and have to choose which
					site should receive the trackback. glFusion will then check if the site
					accepts trackbacks and try to determine the actual trackback URL
					to send the Trackback to.
				</p>

				<p>
					You will now get a form that includes information about your post
					(title, URL, URL of your site and the text of your post). If glFusion
					could determine the Trackback URL, that field will also be filled in.
					If the Trackback URL is missing, then either glFusion could not find
					the Trackback URL by itself (in which case you can add it manually)
					or the target site (Mary's, in the above example) does not accept
					Trackbacks.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can - and should - now edit the excerpt from your post. Please note
					that many sites will shorten the excerpt, typically to something like
					255 characters. Also keep in mind that the excerpt will be displayed on
					Mary's site, so it should contain a portion of your post that will make
					it clear to a visitor of Mary's site why that post shows up there (i.e.
					it should somehow refer to Mary's post).
				</p>

				<p>
					You can then choose to see a preview of your post (but keep in mind
					that it may not be displayed in the exact same way on Mary's site)
					and / or send the Trackback.
				</p>

				<h1>Trackback vs. Pingback</h1>

				<p>
					Since, as mentioned above, Trackback and Pingback offer pretty much
					the same functionality, you should really only send one of the two. So
					if Mary's site offers both options, you should think about which of the
					two makes more sense to you for that particular post.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pingbacks provide less information (typically only a link back to
					your site) but they are automated and therefore easier and faster to
					send. Trackbacks allow you to send more information (e.g. an excerpt
					from your post) but preparing that information takes more time.
				</p>

				<h1>Receiving Trackbacks and Pingbacks</h1>

				<p>
					Your glFusion site will, of course, be able to receive Trackbacks
					and Pingbacks to your stories. They will show up in a dedicated section
					below the story, similar to the section for comments. Once received,
					glFusion will treat Trackbacks and Pingbacks the same, so you won't be
					able to tell the difference.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you disable Trackbacks and / or Pingbacks in the configuration,
					you will also disable receiving them.
				</p>

				<h1>Ping</h1>

				<p>
					Pings are meant to be sent to certain websites that keep track of
					blog posts. glFusion comes pre-configured for pinging Ping-o-Matic, a
					service that in turn will ping other services (see their site for
					details). You can easily add others or delete / disable the existing
					entry (from the Admin's &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; entry).
				</p>

				<p>
					Weblog directory services will usually accept either a standard or
					an extended ping. The difference is that the &ldquo;extended&rdquo;
					Ping will also include a link to your site's feed (RSS, Atom, or
					whatever you chose).
				</p>

				<p>
					When you click on the &ldquo;Send Ping&rdquo; button for a
					story, all currently enabled weblog directories will be notified
					automatically.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pinging a weblog directory service will also ensure that your site is
					included in Google's blog search.
				</p>

				<h1>Disabling Trackbacks</h1>

				<p>
					Since these functions may not be needed on certain sites (e.g.
					corporate sites), they can be switched off individually in the
					configuration.
				</p>

				<p>
					Note that &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; is sometimes used as
					a generic term for both
					trackbacks and pingbacks. So when you disable trackbacks but leave
					pingbacks enabled, you will still see references to
					&ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; in a
					few places.
				</p>

				<p>
					Only when all three, i.e. trackbacks, pingbacks, and pings are
					disabled will the &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; entry vanish from the
					Admins Only block.
					At that point, the only reference to trackbacks that you'll still see
					is the drop-down menu entry in the Admin's story editor (to
					enable/disable trackbacks on a per-story basis). But its setting is
					overridden by the configuration settings, so it can be ignored.
